CHANGES:

- jQuery knowledge gap - funcionality in jQuery is implemented as a set of plugins - (basically just function calls)
- Checklist - show list - don't talk about it
- options/defaults -> "merging the options from our caller with the defaults so we have a complete set of options"
- skip audience interaction - play devil's advocate
- switch to stills
- dragTracker "callbacks" - talk about derivation
- Closing: Recap -> reusable plugins follow the checklist (DIY or 3rd party) - ui widgets can be modularized even further by learning to notice UI patterns

TODO:
- Closing slides
- Practice!
